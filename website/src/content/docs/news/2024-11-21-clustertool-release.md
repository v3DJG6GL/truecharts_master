Clustertool has reached a major milestone with the release of version 1.0.0, moving out of its release candidate (RC) phase.
The tool is designed to simplify the process of bootstrapping Talos clusters, offering users a quick and easy way to get started.

It comes pre-configured with essential Kubernetes components, including Cillium, MetalLB,
and Longhorn, ensuring clusters are equipped with key functionalities right out of the box.
Additionally, all charts required in our Quick Start guide come preinstalled.

Clustertool also includes a fully configured VS Code devcontainer that automatically installs all the necessary tools for managing and maintaining your Talos clusters.
This addition is a significant time-saver for people setting up their environments.
